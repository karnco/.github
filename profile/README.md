# Karn & Co. α
## A non-real corporation (as of now) by [@Raghav Karn](https://github.com/raghav-karn).

#### We can be the next ones to dent the universe, make groundbreaking impacts. Here's our motives and beliefs:
- Strive for **Perfection**. A product not perfect is a bad product.
> "If you want to do something in your lives, why not make it beautiful?"
- Be **creative** with workarounds, avoid compromises.
- **Simple and minimal design** is the best design.
> "Simplicity is ultimate sophistication."
- Remember,
> "Nothing is impossible. Even 'impossible' says, 'I am Possible.'"


Join us and embark on this harsh yet beautiful journey of time, of creating lives and a new world. The bittersweet life!

`PS:` We are not a "help in disasters" or "build lives, help poor" kind of company. We build electronics.

- [ ] Let's do it!
