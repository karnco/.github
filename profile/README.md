# `α` | `Karn & Co.`
### A non-real *(as of now)* corporation by [`@Raghav Karn`](https://github.com/raghav-karn).

We can be the next ones to *dent the universe*, make groundbreaking impacts. Here's our motives and beliefs:
- Strive for **Perfection**. A product not perfect is a *bad* product.
> "If you want to do something in your lives, why not make it *beautiful*?"
- Be **creative** with workarounds, avoid compromises.
- **Simple and minimal design** is the best design. Material design is not bad.
> "Simplicity is ultimate *sophistication*."
- Remember,
> "Nothing is impossible. Even 'impossible' says, '*I'm possible*.' "

Join us and embark on this harsh yet beautiful journey of time, of creating lives and a new world. The bittersweet life!

`PS:` We are not a "help in disasters" or "build lives, help poor" kind of company. We innovate tech, the future.

- [ ] Let's do it!

### — Raghav Karn, founder, owner & CEO at [Karn & Co.](https://github.com/karnco)
